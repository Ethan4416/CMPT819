    "# Step 1: Write your Segmentation Algoirthm\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that segments a leaf image, and returns a binary (`dtype='bool'`) image representing the segmentation.  Your algorithm must be based on thresholding.  Determine a metric that can be used to meaure the \"greenness\" of the colour of a given pixel.  Your algoirthm should create a \"feature map\" by computing this feature for each pixel, thus creating an \"image\" where each pixel's \"intensity\" is the value of the \"greenness\" feature.   Then use a thresholding method of your choice to segment the image's green regions.    You should also consider whether doing some region processing after segmentation can improve the results.  This function should return the segmenetion of the image as a binary image with a single connected component since you can take advantage of the fact that each image is known to contain only a single leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint: You'll need to be a bit creative when devising your solution -- no single technique from class is likely to give you a particularly good solution, and you may need to think of some tricks that were not explicitly covered in class.  However, you can get a good result with a fairly simple algorithm.  You'll also need to decide how to handle the fact that the input images are colour, although this shouldn't pose too much of a problem, in fact, it is an advantage!_"
